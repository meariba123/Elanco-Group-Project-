## Animal Activity Monitoring â€“ Elanco Group Project

**Summary:**  
Collaborative university project in partnership with Elanco to explore animal behaviour monitoring using cloud-based cognitive services. Our goal was to build a web-based prototype that classifies animal activities in images using cloud AI (Azure Vision AI, Google Vertex AI, etc.).

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Node.js backend
- PWA for mobile and desktop
- Cloud Vision AI APIs

## My Contributions
- Developed the entire **frontend** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Built a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** for both mobile and desktop.
- Created an **accessible Dyslexia Mode** (soft yellow background + high-contrast text).
- Added:
  - Responsive design for all screen sizes
  - Loading spinner for smoother user experience
  - Page navigation and redirection logic
  - Form validation and interactive UI elements
  - Contact/help page with direct email button
- Worked closely with backend devs to integrate frontend with Node.js

## App screenshots:
Below are some screenshots demonstrating the core features and interface of the application, including the responsive design, Dyslexia Mode, and user-friendly layout across mobile and desktop:
